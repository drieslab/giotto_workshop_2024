# Contributing to Giotto

## Contribution guideline

To be updated...
<https://drieslab.github.io/Giotto_website/CONTRIBUTING.html>

We welcome contributions or suggestions from other developers. Please
contact us if you have questions or would like to discuss an addition or
major modifications to the Giotto main code. The source code for Giotto
Suite may be found on our GitHub repository.

## Coding Style 

Following a particular programming style will help programmers read and
understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid
introducing errors. Here we present a small list of guidelines on what
is considered a good practice when writing R codes in Giotto package.
Most of them are adapted from Bioconductor - coding style or Google’s R
Style Guide. These guidelines are preferences and strongly encouraged!

-   **Naming**

    -   Use `camelCase` for Giotto user-facing exported function names.
        (`functionName()`)

    -   Use `snake_case` for non-user-facing exported functions, which
        are essentially any functions not directly related to commonly
        used data processing, analysis, and visualization.
        (`function_name()`)

    -   Use `.` prefix and snake_case for internal non-exported
        functions. (`.function_name()`)

    -   Use `snake_case` for parameter names.

    -   Do not use `.` as a separator in function naming. (in the S3
        class system, some(x) where x is class A will dispatch to
        some.A)

-   **Use of `` ` ` `` (space) characters**

    -   Do not place a space before a comma, but always place one after
        a comma. This: a, b, c. Always use space around `=` when using
        named arguments to functions. This: somefunc(a = 1, b = 2).

-   **Use of symbols** Do not use any non-UTF-8 characters unless
    provided as the escape code. For example: `\u00F6` for `ö` Beyond
    these guidelines, styler should be used in order to maintain code
    uniformity.

## Stat functions 

Most Giotto commands can accept several matrix classes (DelayedMatrix,
SparseM, Matrix or base matrix). To facilitate this we provide flexible
wrappers that work on any type of matrix class.

mean_flex: analogous to mean() rowSums_flex: analogous to rowSums()
rowMeans_flex: analogous to rowMeans() colSums_flex: analogous to
colSums() colMeans_flex: analogous to colMeans() t_flex: analogous to
t() cor_flex: analogous to cor()

## Auxiliary functions

Giotto has a number of auxiliary or convenience functions that might
help you to adapt your code or write new code for Giotto. We encourage
you to use these small functions to maintain uniformity throughout the
code.

lapply_flex: analogous to lapply() and works for both windows and unix
systems all_plots_save_function: compatible with Giotto instructions and
helps to automatically save generated plots plot_output_handler: further
wraps all_plots_save_function and includes handling for return_plot and
show_plot and Giotto instructions checking determine_cores: to determine
the number of cores to use if a user does not set this explicitly
get_os: to identify the operating system update_giotto_params: will
catch and store the parameters for each used command on a giotto object
wrap_txt and wrap_msg: text and message formatting functions vmsg:
framework for Giotto’s verbosity-flagged messages package_check: to
check if a package exists, works for packages on CRAN, Bioconductor and
Github The last function should be used within your contribution code.
It has the additional benefit that it will suggest the user how to
download the package if it is not available. To keep the size of Giotto
within limits we prefer not to add too many new dependencies.

## Package Imports

Giotto tracks packages and functions to import in a centralized manner.
When adding code that requires functions from another package, add the
roxygen tags to the package_imports.R file for that Giotto module.

Getters and Setters Giotto stores information in different slots, which
can be accessed through these getters and setters functions. They can be
found in the accessors.R file.

getCellMetadata(): Gets cell metadata

setCellMetadata(): Sets cell metadata

getFeatureMetadata(): Gets feature metadata

getFeatureMetadata(): Sets feature metadata

getExpression(): To select the expression matrix to use

setExpression(): Sets a new expression matrix to the expression slot

getSpatialLocations(): Get spatial locations to use

setSpatialLocations(): Sets new spatial locations

getDimReduction(): To select the dimension reduction values to use

setDimReduction(): Sets new dimension reduction object

getNearestNetwork(): To select the nearest neighbor network (kNN or sNN)
to use

setNearestNetwork(): Sets a new nearest neighbor network (kNN or sNN)

getSpatialNetwork(): To select the spatial network to use

setSpatialNetwork(): Sets a new spatial network

getPolygonInfo(): Gets spatial polygon information

setPolygonInfo(): Set new spatial polygon information

getFeatureInfo(): Gets spatial feature information

setFeatureInfo(): Sets new spatial feature information

getSpatialEnrichment(): Gets spatial enrichment information

setSpatialEnrichment(): Sets new spatial enrichment information

getMultiomics(): Gets multiomics information

setMultiomics(): Sets multiomics information

## Python code 

To use Python code we prefer to create a python wrapper/functions around
the python code, which can then be sourced by reticulate. As an example
we show the basic principles of how we implemented the Leiden clustering
algorithm.

write python wrapper and store as python_leiden.py in /inst/python:
import igraph as ig import leidenalg as la import pandas as pd import
networkx as nx

def python_leiden(df, partition_type, initial_membership=None,
weights=None, n_iterations=2, seed=None, resolution_parameter = 1):

```         
# create networkx object
Gx = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df = df, source = 'from', target =  'to', edge_attr = 'weight')  

# get weight attribute
myweights = nx.get_edge_attributes(Gx, 'weight')

....

return(leiden_dfr)
```

source python code with reticulate: python_leiden_function =
system.file("python", "python_leiden.py", package = 'Giotto')
reticulate::source_python(file = python_leiden_function) use python code
as if R code: See doLeidenCLuster for more detailed information.
pyth_leid_result = python_leiden(df = network_edge_dt, partition_type =
partition_type, initial_membership = init_membership, weights =
'weight', n_iterations = n_iterations, seed = seed_number,
resolution_parameter = resolution)
